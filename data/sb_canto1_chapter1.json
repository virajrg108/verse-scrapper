This fact will be more explicitly explained in the text of this work. \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva asserts herein that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Personality of Godhead, and all others are His direct or indirect plenary portions or portions of the portion. \u015ar\u012bla J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b has even more explicitly explained the subject matter in his <i>K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sandarbha.</i> And Brahm\u0101, the original living being, has explained the subject of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a substantially in his treatise named <i>Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101.</i> In an <i>Upani\u1e63ad</i> in the <i>S\u0101ma-veda,</i> it is also stated that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the divine son of Devak\u012b. Therefore, in this prayer, the first proposition holds that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord, and if any transcendental nomenclature is to be understood as belonging to the Absolute Personality of Godhead, it must be the name indicated by the word K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which means the all-attractive. In <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a>,</i> in many places, the Lord asserts Himself to be the original Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed by Arjuna, and also by great sages like N\u0101rada, Vy\u0101sa, and many others. In the <i>Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a,</i> it is also stated that out of the innumerable names of the Lord, the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the principal one. V\u0101sudeva indicates the plenary portion of the Personality of Godhead, and all the different forms of the Lord, being identical with V\u0101sudeva, are indicated in this text. The name V\u0101sudeva particularly indicates the divine son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b. \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is always meditated upon by the <i>paramaha\u1e41sas,</i> who are the perfected ones among those in the renounced order of life.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13397\"><p>V\u0101sudeva, or Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the cause of all causes. Everything that exists emanates from the Lord. How this is so is explained in later chapters of this work. This work is described by Mah\u0101prabhu \u015ar\u012b Caitanya as the spotless <i>Pur\u0101\u1e47a</i> because it contains the transcendental narration of the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The history of the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> is also very glorious. It was compiled by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva after he had attained maturity in transcendental knowledge. He wrote this under the instructions of \u015ar\u012b N\u0101radaj\u012b, his spiritual master. Vy\u0101sadeva compiled all Vedic literatures, containing the four divisions of the <i>Vedas,</i> the <i>Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras</i> (or the <i>Brahma-s\u016btras</i>), the <i>Pur\u0101\u1e47as,</i> the <i>Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata,</i> and so on. But nevertheless he was not satisfied. His dissatisfaction was observed by his spiritual master, and thus N\u0101rada advised him to write on the transcendental activities of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These transcendental activities are described specifically in the Tenth Canto of this work. But, in order to reach to the very substance, one must proceed gradually by developing knowledge of the categories.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13398\"><p>It is natural that a philosophical mind wants to know about the origin of the creation. At night he sees the stars in the sky, and he naturally speculates about their inhabitants. Such inquiries are natural for man because man has a developed consciousness which is higher than that of the animals. The author of <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> gives a direct answer to such inquiries. He says that the Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all creations. He is not only the creator of the universe, but the destroyer as well. The manifested cosmic nature is created at a certain period by the will of the Lord. It is maintained for some time, and then it is annihilated by His will. Therefore, the supreme will is behind all cosmic activities. Of course, there are atheists of various categories who do not believe in a creator, but that is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The modern scientist, for example, has created space satellites, and by some arrangement or other, these satellites are thrown into outer space to fly for some time at the control of the scientist who is far away. Similarly, all the universes with innumerable stars and planets are controlled by the intelligence of the Personality of Godhead.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13399\"><p>In Vedic literatures, it is said that the Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, is the chief amongst all living personalities. All living beings, beginning from the first created being, Brahm\u0101, down to the smallest ant, are individual living beings. And above Brahm\u0101, there are even other living beings with individual capacities, and the Personality of Godhead is also a similar living being. And He is an individual as are the other living beings. But the Supreme Lord, or the supreme living being, has the greatest intelligence, and He possesses supermost inconceivable energies of all different varieties. If a man\u2019s brain can produce a space satellite, one can very easily imagine how brains higher than man can produce similarly wonderful things which are far superior. The reasonable person will easily accept this argument, but there are stubborn atheists who would never agree. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, however, at once accepts the supreme intelligence as the <i>parame\u015bvara.</i> He offers his respectful obeisances unto the supreme intelligence addressed as the <i>para</i> or the <i>parame\u015bvara</i> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that <i>parame\u015bvara</i> is \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as admitted in <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> and other scriptures delivered by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva and specifically in this <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a>.</i> In <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a>,</i> the Lord says that there is no other <i>para-tattva</i> (<i>summum bonum</i>) than Himself. Therefore, \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva at once worships the <i>para-tattva,</i> \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, whose transcendental activities are described in the Tenth Canto.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13400\"><p>Unscrupulous persons go immediately to the Tenth Canto and especially to the five chapters which describe the Lord\u2019s <i>r\u0101sa</i> dance. This portion of the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> is the most confidential part of this great literature. Unless one is thoroughly accomplished in the transcendental knowledge of the Lord, one is sure to misunderstand the Lord\u2019s worshipable transcendental pastimes called <i>r\u0101sa</i> dance and His love affairs with the <i>gop\u012bs.</i> This subject matter is highly spiritual, and only the liberated persons who have gradually attained to the stage of <i>paramaha\u1e41sa</i> can transcendentally relish this <i>r\u0101sa</i> dance. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva therefore gives the reader the chance to gradually develop spiritual realization before actually relishing the essence of the pastimes of the Lord. Therefore, he purposely invokes a G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra, dh\u012bmahi.</i> This G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra</i> is meant for spiritually advanced people. When one is successful in chanting the G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra,</i> he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must therefore acquire brahminical qualities or be perfectly situated in the quality of goodness in order to chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra</i> successfully and then attain to the stage of transcendentally realizing the Lord, His name, His fame, His qualities and so on.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13401\"><p><i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> is the narration of the <i>svar\u016bpa</i> of the Lord manifested by His internal potency, and this potency is distinguished from the external potency which has manifested the cosmic world, which is within our experience. \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva makes a clear distinction between the two in this <i>\u015bloka.</i> \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva says herein that the manifested internal potency is real, whereas the external manifested energy in the form of material existence is only temporary and illusory like the mirage in the desert. In the desert mirage there is no actual water. There is only the appearance of water. Real water is somewhere else. The manifested cosmic creation appears as reality. But reality, of which this is but a shadow, is in the spiritual world. Absolute Truth is in the spiritual sky, not the material sky. In the material sky everything is relative truth. That is to say, one truth depends on something else. This cosmic creation results from interaction of the three modes of nature, and the temporary manifestations are so created as to present an illusion of reality to the bewildered mind of the conditioned soul, who appears in so many species of life, including the higher demigods, like Brahm\u0101, Indra, Candra, and so on. In actuality, there is no reality in the manifested world. There appears to be reality, however, because of the true reality which exists in the spiritual world, where the Personality of Godhead eternally exists with His transcendental paraphernalia.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13402\"><p>The chief engineer of a complicated construction does not personally take part in the construction, but he knows every nook and corner because everything is done under his direction. He knows everything about the construction, both directly and indirectly. Similarly, the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme engineer of this cosmic creation, knows every nook and corner, although affairs are being carried out by demigods. Beginning from Brahm\u0101 down to the insignificant ant, no one is independent in the material creation. The hand of the Lord is seen everywhere. All material elements as well as all spiritual sparks emanate from Him only. And whatever is created in this material world is but the interaction of two energies, the material and the spiritual, which emanate from the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A chemist can manufacture water in the chemical laboratory by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. But, in reality, the living entity works in the laboratory under the direction of the Supreme Lord. And the materials with which he works are also supplied by the Lord. The Lord knows everything directly and indirectly, and He is cognizant of all minute details, and He is fully independent. He is compared to a mine of gold, and the cosmic creations in so many different forms are compared to objects made from the gold, such as gold rings, necklaces and so on. The gold ring and the gold necklace are qualitatively one with the gold in the mine, but quantitatively the gold in the mine is different. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is simultaneously one and different. Nothing is absolutely equal with the Absolute Truth, but at the same time, nothing is independent of the Absolute Truth.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13403\"><p>Conditioned souls, beginning from Brahm\u0101, who engineers the entire universe, down to the insignificant ant, are all creating, but none of them is independent of the Supreme Lord. The materialist wrongly thinks that there is no creator other than his own self. This is called <i>m\u0101y\u0101,</i> or illusion. Because of his poor fund of knowledge, the materialist cannot see beyond the purview of his imperfect senses, and thus he thinks that matter automatically takes its own shape without the aid of a superior intelligence. This is refuted in this <i>\u015bloka</i> by \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva: \u201cSince the complete whole or the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, nothing can be independent of the body of the Absolute Truth.\u201d Whatever happens to the body quickly becomes known to the embodied. Similarly, the creation is the body of the absolute whole. Therefore, the Absolute knows everything directly and indirectly that happens in the creation.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13404\"><p>In the <i>\u015bruti-mantra,</i> it is also stated that the absolute whole or Brahman is the ultimate source of everything. Everything emanates from Him, and everything is maintained by Him. And at the end, everything enters into Him. That is the law of nature. In the <i>sm\u1e5bti-mantra,</i> the same is confirmed. It is said that the source from which everything emanates at the beginning of Brahm\u0101\u2019s millennium, and the reservoir to which everything ultimately enters, is the Absolute Truth, or Brahman. Material scientists take it for granted that the ultimate source of the planetary system is the sun, but they are unable to explain the source of the sun. Herein, the ultimate source is explained. According to the Vedic literatures, Brahm\u0101, who may be compared to the sun, is not the ultimate creator. It is stated in this <i>\u015bloka</i> that Brahm\u0101 was taught Vedic knowledge by the Personality of Godhead. One may argue that Brahm\u0101, being the original living being, could not be inspired because there was no other being living at that time. Herein it is stated that the Supreme Lord inspired the secondary creator, Brahm\u0101, in order that Brahm\u0101 could carry out his creative functions. So, the supreme intelligence behind all creations is the Absolute Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a>,</i> Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a states that it is He only who superintends the creative energy, <i>prak\u1e5bti,</i> which constitutes the totality of matter. Therefore, \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva does not worship Brahm\u0101, but the Supreme Lord, who guides Brahm\u0101 in his creative activities. In this <i>\u015bloka,</i> the particular words <i>abhij\u00f1a\u1e25</i> and <i>svar\u0101\u1e6d</i> are significant. These two words distinguish the Supreme Lord from all the other living entities. No other living entity is either <i>abhij\u00f1a\u1e25</i> or <i>svar\u0101\u1e6d.</i> That is, no one is either fully cognizant or fully independent. Even Brahm\u0101 has to meditate upon the Supreme Lord in order to create. Then what to speak of great scientists like Einstein! The brains of such a scientist are certainly not the products of any human being. Scientists cannot manufacture such a brain, and what to speak of foolish atheists who defy the authority of the Lord? Even M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b impersonalists who flatter themselves that they can become one with the Lord are neither <i>abhij\u00f1a\u1e25</i> nor <i>svar\u0101\u1e6d.</i> Such impersonalists undergo severe austerities to acquire knowledge to become one with the Lord. But ultimately they become dependent on some rich disciple who supplies them with money to build monasteries and temples. Atheists like R\u0101va\u1e47a or Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu had to undergo severe penances before they could flout the authority of the Lord. But ultimately, they were rendered helpless and could not save themselves when the Lord appeared before them as cruel death. This is also the case with the modern atheists who also dare to flout the authority of the Lord. Such atheists will be dealt with similarly, for history repeats itself. Whenever men neglect the authority of the Lord, nature and her laws are there to penalize them. This is confirmed in <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> <a href=\"/en/library/bg/4/7/\">(Bg. 4.7)</a> in the well-known verse <i>yad\u0101 yad\u0101 hi dharmasya gl\u0101ni\u1e25.</i> \u201cWhenever there is a decline of <i>dharma</i> and a rise of <i>adharma,</i> O Arjuna, then I incarnate Myself.\u201d</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13405\"><p>That the Supreme Lord is all-perfect is confirmed in all <i>\u015bruti-mantras.</i> It is said in the <i>\u015bruti-mantras</i> that the all-perfect Lord threw a glance over matter and thus created all living beings. The living beings are parts and parcels of the Lord, and He impregnates the vast material creation with seeds of spiritual sparks, and thus the creative energies are set in motion to enact so many wonderful creations. An atheist may argue that God is no more expert than a watchmaker, but of course God is greater because He can create machines in duplicate male and female forms. The male and female forms of different types of machineries go on producing innumerable similar machines without God\u2019s further attention. If a man could manufacture such a set of machines that could produce other machines without his attention, then he could approach the intelligence of God. But that is not possible, for each machine has to be handled individually. Therefore, no one can create as well as God. Another name for God is <i>asamordhva,</i> which means that no one is equal to or greater than Him. <i>Para\u1e41 satyam,</i> or the Supreme Truth, is He who has no equal or superior. This is confirmed in the <i>\u015bruti-mantras.</i> It is said that before the creation of the material universe there existed the Lord only, who is master of everyone. That Lord instructed Brahm\u0101 in Vedic knowledge. That Lord has to be obeyed in all respects. Anyone who wants to get rid of the material entanglement must surrender unto Him. This is also confirmed in <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a>.</i></p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13406\"><p>Unless one surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, it is certain that he will be bewildered. When an intelligent man surrenders unto the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and knows completely that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes, as confirmed in <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a>,</i> then only can such an intelligent man become a <i>mah\u0101tm\u0101,</i> or great soul. But such a great soul is rarely seen. Only the <i>mah\u0101tm\u0101s</i> can understand that the Supreme Lord is the primeval cause of all creations. He is <i>parama</i> or ultimate truth because all other truths are relative to Him. He is omniscient. For Him, there is no illusion.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13407\"><p>Some M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b scholars argue that <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> was not compiled by \u015ar\u012b Vy\u0101sadeva. And some of them suggest that this book is a modern creation written by someone named Vopadeva. In order to refute such meaningless arguments, \u015ar\u012b \u015ar\u012bdhara Sv\u0101m\u012b points out that there is reference to the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> in many of the oldest <i>Pur\u0101\u1e47as.</i> This first <i>\u015bloka</i> of the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> begins with the G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra.</i> There is reference to this in the <i>Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47a,</i> which is the oldest <i>Pur\u0101\u1e47a.</i> In that <i>Pur\u0101\u1e47a,</i> it is said with reference to the G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra</i> in the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> that there are many narrations of spiritual instructions beginning with the G\u0101yatr\u012b <i>mantra.</i> And there is the history of V\u1e5btr\u0101sura. Anyone who makes a gift of this great work on a full moon day attains to the highest perfection of life by returning to Godhead. There is reference to the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> in other <i>Pur\u0101\u1e47as</i> also, where it is clearly stated that this work was finished in twelve cantos, which include eighteen thousand <i>\u015blokas.</i> In the <i>Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a</i> also there is reference to the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> in a conversation between Gautama and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ambar\u012b\u1e63a. The king was advised therein to read regularly <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> if he desired liberation from material bondage. Under the circumstances, there is no doubt about the authority of the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a>.</i> Within the past five hundred years, many erudite scholars and <i>\u0101c\u0101ryas</i> like J\u012bva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, San\u0101tana Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b, Vallabh\u0101c\u0101rya, and many other distinguished scholars even after the time of Lord Caitanya made elaborate commentaries on the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a>.</i> And the serious student would do well to attempt to go through them to better relish the transcendental messages.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13408\"><p>\u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura specifically deals with the original and pure sex psychology (<i>\u0101di-rasa</i>), devoid of all mundane inebriety. <i>The whole material creation is moving under the principle of sex life.</i> In modern civilization, sex life is the focal point for all activities. Wherever one turns his face, he sees sex life predominant. Therefore, sex life is not unreal. Its reality is experienced in the spiritual world. The material sex life is but a perverted reflection of the original fact. The original fact is in the Absolute Truth, and thus the Absolute Truth cannot be impersonal. It is not possible to be impersonal and contain pure sex life. Consequently, the impersonalist philosophers have given indirect impetus to the abominable mundane sex life because they have overstressed the impersonality of the ultimate truth. Consequently, man without information of the actual spiritual form of sex has accepted perverted material sex life as the all in all. There is a distinction between sex life in the diseased material condition and spiritual sex life.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13409\"><p>This <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> will gradually elevate the unbiased reader to the highest perfectional stage of transcendence.
