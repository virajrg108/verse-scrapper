Yet the unhappy materialists can get out of it simply by desiring to get out. Unfortunately they are so foolish that they do not want to escape. Therefore they are compared to the camel who relishes thorny twigs because he likes the taste of the twigs mixed with blood. He does not realize that it is his own blood and that his tongue is being cut by the thorns. Similarly, to the materialist his own blood is as sweet as honey, and although he is always harassed by his own material creations, he does not wish to escape. Such materialists are called <i>karm\u012bs.</i> Out of hundreds of thousands of <i>karm\u012bs,</i> only a few may feel tired of material engagement and desire to get out of the labyrinth. Such intelligent persons are called <i>j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs.</i> The <i>Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra</i> is directed to such <i>j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs.</i> But \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva, being the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, could foresee the misuse of the <i>Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra</i> by unscrupulous men, and, therefore, he personally supplemented the <i>Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra</i> with the <i>Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a.</i> It is clearly said that this <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> is the original commentary on the <i>Brahma-s\u016btras.</i> \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva also instructed the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> to his own son, \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, who was already at the liberated stage of transcendence. \u015ar\u012bla \u015aukadeva realized it personally and then explained it.

The sages asked him to summarize the whole range of revealed scriptures and present the most essential part so that fallen people or the people in general might easily take it up. The <i>Vedas</i> prescribe two different types of occupation for the human being. One is called the <i>prav\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga,</i> or the path of sense enjoyment, and the other is called the <i>niv\u1e5btti-m\u0101rga,</i> or the path of renunciation. The path of enjoyment is inferior, and the path of sacrifice for the supreme cause is superior. The material existence of the living being is a diseased condition of actual life. Actual life is spiritual existence, or <i>brahma-bh\u016bta</i> existence, where life is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Material existence is temporary, illusory and full of miseries. There is no happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Therefore, the path of progressive material enjoyment, which is temporary, miserable and illusory, is inferior. But devotional service to the Supreme Lord, which leads one to eternal, blissful and all-cognizant life, is called the superior quality of occupation. This is sometimes polluted when mixed with the inferior quality. For example, adoption of devotional service for material gain is certainly an obstruction to the progressive path of renunciation. Renunciation or abnegation for ultimate good is certainly a better occupation than enjoyment in the diseased condition of life. Such enjoyment only aggravates the symptoms of disease and increases its duration. Therefore devotional service to the Lord must be pure in quality, i.e., without the least desire for material enjoyment. One should, therefore, accept the superior quality of occupation in the form of the devotional service of the Lord without any tinge of unnecessary desire, fruitive action and philosophical speculation. This alone can lead one to perpetual solace in His service.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13587\"><p>We have purposely denoted <i>dharma</i> as occupation because the root meaning of the word <i>dharma</i> is \u201cthat which sustains one\u2019s existence.\u201d A living being\u2019s sustenance of existence is to coordinate his activities with his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the central pivot of living beings, and He is the all-attractive living entity or eternal form amongst all other living beings or eternal forms. Each and every living being has his eternal form in the spiritual existence, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal attraction for all of them. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the complete whole, and everything else is His part and parcel. The relation is one of the servant and the served. It is transcendental and is completely distinct from our experience in material existence. This relation of servant and the served is the most congenial form of intimacy. One can realize it as devotional service progresses. Everyone should engage himself in that transcendental loving service of the Lord, even in the present conditional state of material existence.

According to them, <i>bhakti,</i> or the devotional service of the Lord, is meant for those who cannot perform the high-grade activities. Generally it is said that the <i>bhakti</i> cult is meant for the <i>\u015b\u016bdras, vai\u015byas</i> and the less intelligent woman class. But that is not the actual fact. The <i>bhakti</i> cult is the topmost of all transcendental activities, and therefore it is simultaneously sublime and easy. It is sublime for the pure devotees who are serious about getting in contact with the Supreme Lord, and it is easy for the neophytes who are just on the threshold of the house of <i>bhakti.</i> To achieve the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is a great science, and it is open for all living beings, including the <i>\u015b\u016bdras, vai\u015byas,</i> women and even those lower than the lowborn <i>\u015b\u016bdras,</i> so what to speak of the high-class men like the qualified <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47as</i> and the great self-realized kings.

The whole spiritual process leads to perfect knowledge of everything material and spiritual, and the results of such perfect knowledge are that one becomes detached from material affection and becomes attached to spiritual activities. Becoming detached from material things does not mean becoming inert altogether, as men with a poor fund of knowledge think. <i>Nai\u1e63karma</i> means not undertaking activities that will produce good or bad effects. Negation does not mean negation of the positive. Negation of the nonessentials does not mean negation of the essential. Similarly, detachment from material forms does not mean nullifying the positive form. The <i>bhakti</i> cult is meant for realization of the positive form. When the positive form is realized, the negative forms are automatically eliminated. Therefore, with the development of the <i>bhakti</i> cult, with the application of positive service to the positive form, one naturally becomes detached from inferior things, and he becomes attached to superior things. Similarly, the <i>bhakti</i> cult, being the supermost occupation of the living being, leads him out of material sense enjoyment. That is the sign of a pure devotee. He is not a fool, nor is he engaged in the inferior energies, nor does he have material values. This is not possible by dry reasoning. It actually happens by the grace of the Almighty. In conclusion, one who is a pure devotee has all other good qualities, namely knowledge, detachment, etc., but one who has only knowledge or detachment is not necessarily well acquainted with the principles of the <i>bhakti</i> cult. <i>Bhakti</i> is the supermost occupation of the human being.</p></div>"}, {"verseNbr": "<h1>\u015aB 1.2.8</h1>", "sanskritText": "\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e: \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093f\u0924: \u092a\u0941\u0902\u0938\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0938\u0947\u0928\u0915\u0925\u093e\u0938\u0941 \u092f: \u0964<br/>\u0928\u094b\u0924\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0926\u092f\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0926\u093f \u0930\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e \u090f\u0935 \u0939\u093f \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u096e \u0965", "englishText": "<em><i>dharma\u1e25 svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25 pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41<br/>vi\u1e63vaksena-kath\u0101su ya\u1e25<br/>notp\u0101dayed yadi rati\u1e41<br/>\u015brama eva hi kevalam</i></em>", "synonyms": "<p><a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=dharma\u1e25\"><em>dharma\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 occupation; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25\"><em>svanu\u1e63\u1e6dhita\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 executed in terms of one\u2019s own position; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=pu\u1e41s\u0101m\"><em>pu\u1e41s\u0101m</em></a> \u2014 of humankind; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=vi\u1e63vaksena\"><em>vi\u1e63vaksena</em></a> \u2014 the Personality of Godhead (plenary portion); <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=kath\u0101su\"><em>kath\u0101su</em></a> \u2014 in the message of; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=ya\u1e25\"><em>ya\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 what is; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=na\"><em>na</em></a> \u2014 not; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=utp\u0101dayet\"><em>utp\u0101dayet</em></a> \u2014 does produce; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=yadi\"><em>yadi</em></a> \u2014 if; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=ratim\"><em>ratim</em></a> \u2014 attraction; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=\u015brama\u1e25\"><em>\u015brama\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 useless labor; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=eva\"><em>eva</em></a> \u2014 only; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=hi\"><em>hi</em></a> \u2014 certainly; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=kevalam\"><em>kevalam</em></a> \u2014 entirely.</p>", "translation": "<p><strong>The occupational activities a man performs according to his own position are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Personality of Godhead.</strong></p>", "purport": "<h2 class=\"section-title\">Purport</h2>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13598\"><p>There are different occupational activities in terms of man\u2019s different conceptions of life.

And what that Absolute Truth is is explained as follows.</p></div>"}, {"verseNbr": "<h1>\u015aB 1.2.11</h1>", "sanskritText": "\u0935\u0926\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u092f\u092e\u094d \u0964<br/>\u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0924\u093f \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0965 \u0967\u0967 \u0965", "englishText": "<em><i>vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br/>tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam<br/>brahmeti param\u0101tmeti<br/>bhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate</i></em>", "synonyms": "<p><a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=vadanti\"><em>vadanti</em></a> \u2014 they say; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=tat\"><em>tat</em></a> \u2014 that; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=tattva\"><em>tattva</em></a>-<a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=vida\u1e25\"><em>vida\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 the learned souls; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=tattvam\"><em>tattvam</em></a> \u2014 the Absolute Truth; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=yat\"><em>yat</em></a> \u2014 which; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=j\u00f1\u0101nam\"><em>j\u00f1\u0101nam</em></a> \u2014 knowledge; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=advayam\"><em>advayam</em></a> \u2014 nondual; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=brahma\"><em>brahma</em></a> <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=iti\"><em>iti</em></a> \u2014 known as Brahman; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=param\u0101tm\u0101\"><em>param\u0101tm\u0101</em></a> <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=iti\"><em>iti</em></a> \u2014 known as Param\u0101tm\u0101; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhagav\u0101n\"><em>bhagav\u0101n</em></a> <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=iti\"><em>iti</em></a> \u2014 known as Bhagav\u0101n; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=\u015babdyate\"><em>\u015babdyate</em></a> \u2014 it so sounded.</p>", "translation": "<p><strong>Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 or Bhagav\u0101n.</strong></p>", "purport": "<h2 class=\"section-title\">Purport</h2>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13616\"><p>The Absolute Truth is both subject and object, and there is no qualitative difference there.

Brahman is His transcendental bodily effulgence, and Param\u0101tm\u0101 is His partial representation. As such, Brahman or Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization of the Absolute Truth is but a partial realization. There are four different types of human beings \u2014 the <i>karm\u012bs,</i> the <i>j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs,</i> the <i>yog\u012bs</i> and the devotees. The <i>karm\u012bs</i> are materialistic, whereas the other three are transcendental. The first-class transcendentalists are the devotees who have realized the Supreme Person. The second-class transcendentalists are those who have partially realized the plenary portion of the Absolute Person. And the third-class transcendentalists are those who have barely realized the spiritual focus of the Absolute Person. As stated in the <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> and other Vedic literatures, the Supreme Person is realized by devotional service, which is backed by full knowledge and detachment from material association. We have already discussed the point that devotional service is followed by knowledge and detachment from material association. As Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization are imperfect realizations of the Absolute Truth, so the means of realizing Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101, i.e., the paths of <i>j\u00f1\u0101na</i> and <i>yoga,</i> are also imperfect means of realizing the Absolute Truth. Devotional service, which is based on the foreground of full knowledge combined with detachment from material association and which is fixed by the aural reception of the <i>Ved\u0101nta-\u015bruti,</i> is the only perfect method by which the seriously inquisitive student can realize the Absolute Truth. Devotional service is not, therefore, meant for the less intelligent class of transcendentalist. There are three classes of devotees, namely first, second, and third class. The third-class devotees, or the neophytes, who have no knowledge and are not detached from material association, but who are simply attracted by the preliminary process of worshiping the Deity in the temple, are called material devotees. Material devotees are more attached to material benefit than transcendental profit. Therefore, one has to make definite progress from the position of material devotional service to the second-class devotional position. In the second-class position, the devotee can see four principles in the devotional line, namely the Personality of Godhead, His devotees, the ignorant and the envious. One has to raise himself at least to the stage of a second-class devotee and thus become eligible to know the Absolute Truth.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13623\"><p>A third-class devotee, therefore, has to receive the instructions of devotional service from the authoritative sources of <i>Bh\u0101gavata.</i> The number one <i>Bh\u0101gavata</i> is the established personality of devotee, and the other <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a></i> is the message of Godhead. The third-class devotee therefore has to go to the personality of devotee in order to learn the instructions of devotional service. Such a personality of devotee is not a professional man who earns his livelihood by the business of <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">Bh\u0101gavatam</a>.</i> Such a devotee must be a representative of \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, like S\u016bta Gosv\u0101m\u012b, and must preach the cult of devotional service for the all-around benefit of all people. A neophyte devotee has very little taste for hearing from the authorities. Such a neophyte devotee makes a show of hearing from the professional man to satisfy his senses. This sort of hearing and chanting has spoiled the whole thing, so one should be very careful about the faulty process. The holy messages of Godhead, as inculcated in the <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> or in the <i><a href=\"/en/library/sb/\">\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam</a>,</i> are undoubtedly transcendental subjects, but even though they are so, such transcendental matters are not to be received from the professional man, who spoils them as the serpent spoils milk simply by the touch of his tongue.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13624\"><p>A sincere devotee must, therefore, be prepared to hear the Vedic literature like the <i>Upani\u1e63ads, Ved\u0101nta</i> and other literatures left by the previous authorities or Gosv\u0101m\u012bs, for the benefit of his progress. Without hearing such literatures, one cannot make actual progress. And without hearing and following the instructions, the show of devotional service becomes worthless and therefore a sort of disturbance in the path of devotional service. Unless, therefore, devotional service is established on the principles of <i>\u015bruti, sm\u1e5bti, pur\u0101\u1e47a</i> or <i>pa\u00f1car\u0101tra</i> authorities, the make-show of devotional service should at once be rejected. An unauthorized devotee should never be recognized as a pure devotee. By assimilation of such messages from the Vedic literatures, one can see the all-pervading localized aspect of the Personality of Godhead within his own self constantly.

No ordinary man, or even one who has attained success in human life, can know scientifically or perfectly the Personality of Godhead. Perfection of human life is attained when one can understand that he is not the product of matter but is in fact spirit. And as soon as one understands that he has nothing to do with matter, he at once ceases his material hankerings and becomes enlivened as a spiritual being. This attainment of success is possible when one is above the modes of passion and ignorance, or, in other words, when one is actually a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a</i> by qualification. A <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a</i> is the symbol of <i>sattva-gu\u1e47a,</i> or the mode of goodness. And others, who are not in the mode of goodness, are either <i>k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas, \u015b\u016bdras</i> or less than the <i>\u015b\u016bdras.</i> The brahminical stage is the highest stage of human life because of its good qualities. So one cannot be a devotee unless one at least qualifies as a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a.</i> The devotee is already a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a</i> by action. But that is not the end of it. As referred to above, such a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a</i> has to become a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava in fact to be actually in the transcendental stage. A pure Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is a liberated soul and is transcendental even to the position of a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a.</i> In the material stage even a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a</i> is also a conditioned soul because although in the brahminical stage the conception of Brahman or transcendence is realized, scientific knowledge of the Supreme Lord is lacking. One has to surpass the brahminical stage and reach the <i>vasudeva</i> stage to understand the Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The science of the Personality of Godhead is the subject matter for study by the postgraduate students in the spiritual line. Foolish men, or men with a poor fund of knowledge, do not understand the Supreme Lord, and they interpret K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a according to their respective whims. The fact is, however, that one cannot understand the science of the Personality of Godhead unless one is freed from the contamination of the material modes, even up to the stage of a <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a.</i> When a qualified <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47a</i> factually becomes a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, in the enlivened state of liberation he can know what is actually the Personality of Godhead.</p></div>"}, {"verseNbr": "<h1>\u015aB 1.2.21</h1>", "sanskritText": "\u092d\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0928\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0936\u094d\u091b\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0938\u0902\u0936\u092f\u093e: \u0964<br/>\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0926\u200d\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f \u090f\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u0940\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0930\u0947 \u0965 \u0968\u0967 \u0965", "englishText": "<em><i>bhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015b<br/>chidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25<br/>k\u1e63\u012byante c\u0101sya karm\u0101\u1e47i<br/>d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da ev\u0101tman\u012b\u015bvare</i></em>", "synonyms": "<p><a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhidyate\"><em>bhidyate</em></a> \u2014 pierced; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=h\u1e5bdaya\"><em>h\u1e5bdaya</em></a> \u2014 heart; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=granthi\u1e25\"><em>granthi\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 knots; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=chidyante\"><em>chidyante</em></a> \u2014 cut to pieces; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=sarva\"><em>sarva</em></a> \u2014 all; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25\"><em>sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 misgivings; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=k\u1e63\u012byante\"><em>k\u1e63\u012byante</em></a> \u2014 terminated; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=ca\"><em>ca</em></a> \u2014 and; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=asya\"><em>asya</em></a> \u2014 his; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=karm\u0101\u1e47i\"><em>karm\u0101\u1e47i</em></a> \u2014 chain of fruitive actions; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6de\"><em>d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6de</em></a> \u2014 having seen; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=eva\"><em>eva</em></a> \u2014 certainly; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=\u0101tmani\"><em>\u0101tmani</em></a> \u2014 unto the self; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=\u012b\u015bvare\"><em>\u012b\u015bvare</em></a> \u2014 dominating.</p>", "translation": "<p><strong>Thus the knot in the heart is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces.

As soon as the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sun is arisen within one\u2019s heart, the darkness of materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth and the living beings is at once cleared off. In the presence of the sun, the darkness cannot stand, and the relative truths that were hidden within the dense darkness of ignorance become clearly manifested by the mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is residing in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13682\"><p>In the <a href=\"/en/library/bg/10/11/\"><i>Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</i> (10.11)</a> the Lord says that in order to show special favor to His pure devotees, He personally eradicates the dense darkness of all misgivings by switching on the light of pure knowledge within the heart of a devotee. Therefore, because of the Personality of Godhead\u2019s taking charge of illuminating the heart of His devotee, certainly a devotee, engaged in His service in transcendental love, cannot remain in darkness. He comes to know everything of the absolute and the relative truths. The devotee cannot remain in darkness, and because a devotee is enlightened by the Personality of Godhead, his knowledge is certainly perfect. This is not the case for those who speculate on the Absolute Truth by dint of their own limited power of approach. Perfect knowledge is called <i>parampar\u0101,</i> or deductive knowledge coming down from the authority to the submissive aural receiver who is bona fide by service and surrender. One cannot challenge the authority of the Supreme and know Him also at the same time. He reserves the right of not being exposed to such a challenging spirit of an insignificant spark of the whole, a spark subjected to the control of illusory energy. The devotees are submissive, and therefore the transcendental knowledge descends from the Personality of Godhead to Brahm\u0101 and from Brahm\u0101 to his sons and disciples in succession. This process is helped by the Supersoul within such devotees. That is the perfect way of learning transcendental knowledge.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13683\"><p>This enlightenment perfectly enables the devotee to distinguish spirit from matter because the knot of spirit and matter is untied by the Lord. This knot is called <i>aha\u1e45k\u0101ra,</i> and it falsely obliges a living being to become identified with matter. As soon as this knot is loosened, therefore, all the clouds of doubt are at once cleared off. One sees his master and fully engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, making a full termination of the chain of fruitive action. In material existence, a living being creates his own chain of fruitive work and enjoys the good and bad effects of those actions life after life. But as soon as he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord, he at once becomes free from the chain of <i>karma.</i> His actions no longer create any reaction.</p></div>"}, {"verseNbr": "<h1>\u015aB 1.2.22</h1>", "sanskritText": "\u0905\u0924\u094b \u0935\u0948 \u0915\u0935\u092f\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u092e\u092f\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0926\u093e \u0964<br/>\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926\u0928\u0940\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0968\u0968 \u0965", "englishText": "<em><i>ato vai kavayo nitya\u1e41<br/>bhakti\u1e41 paramay\u0101 mud\u0101<br/>v\u0101sudeve bhagavati<br/>kurvanty \u0101tma-pras\u0101dan\u012bm</i></em>", "synonyms": "<p><a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=ata\u1e25\"><em>ata\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 therefore; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=vai\"><em>vai</em></a> \u2014 certainly; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=kavaya\u1e25\"><em>kavaya\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 all transcendentalists; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=nityam\"><em>nityam</em></a> \u2014 from time immemorial; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhaktim\"><em>bhaktim</em></a> \u2014 service unto the Lord; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=paramay\u0101\"><em>paramay\u0101</em></a> \u2014 supreme; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=mud\u0101\"><em>mud\u0101</em></a> \u2014 with great delight; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=v\u0101sudeve\"><em>v\u0101sudeve</em></a> \u2014 \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhagavati\"><em>bhagavati</em></a> \u2014 the Personality of Godhead; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=kurvanti\"><em>kurvanti</em></a> \u2014 do render; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=\u0101tma\"><em>\u0101tma</em></a> \u2014 self; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=pras\u0101dan\u012bm\"><em>pras\u0101dan\u012bm</em></a> \u2014 that which enlivens.</p>", "translation": "<p><strong>Certainly, therefore, since time immemorial, all transcendentalists have been rendering devotional service to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, with great delight, because such devotional service is enlivening to the self.</strong></p>", "purport": "<h2 class=\"section-title\">Purport</h2>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13688\"><p>The speciality of devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is specifically mentioned herein.

Brahm\u0101 is the deity of <i>rajas</i> (passion), and \u015aiva of ignorance. They are the three departmental heads of the three qualities of this material world. Creation is made possible by Brahm\u0101\u2019s quality of passion and his endeavor, it is maintained by the goodness of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and when it requires to be destroyed, Lord \u015aiva does it by the <i>t\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davan\u1e5btya.</i> The materialists and the foolish human beings worship Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva respectively. But the pure transcendentalists worship the form of goodness, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, in His various forms. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is manifested by His millions and billions of integrated forms and separated forms. The integrated forms are called Godhead, and the separated forms are called the living entities or the <i>j\u012bvas.</i> Both the <i>j\u012bvas</i> and Godhead have their original spiritual forms. <i>J\u012bvas</i> are sometimes subjected to the control of material energy, but the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u forms are always controllers of this energy. When Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Personality of Godhead, appears in the material world, He comes to deliver the conditioned living beings who are under the material energy. Such living beings appear in the material world with intentions of being lords, and thus they become entrapped by the three modes of nature. As such, the living entities have to change their material coverings for undergoing different terms of imprisonment. The prison house of the material world is created by Brahm\u0101 under instruction of the Personality of Godhead, and at the conclusion of a <i>kalpa</i> the whole thing is destroyed by \u015aiva. But as far as maintenance of the prison house is concerned, it is done by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as much as the state prison house is maintained by the state. Anyone, therefore, who wishes to get out of this prison house of material existence, which is full of miseries like repetition of birth, death, disease and old age, must please Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u for such liberation. Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped by devotional service only, and if anyone has to continue prison life in the material world, he may ask for relative facilities for temporary relief from the different demigods like \u015aiva, Brahm\u0101, Indra and Varu\u1e47a. No demigod, however, can release the imprisoned living being from the conditioned life of material existence. This can be done only by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

That is the sum and substance of the <i>Vedas.</i> In the <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> the same theory is confirmed by the Lord in His own words: the ultimate purpose of the <i>Vedas</i> is to know Him only. All the revealed scriptures are prepared by the Lord through His incarnation in the body of \u015ar\u012bla Vy\u0101sadeva just to remind the fallen souls, conditioned by material nature, of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead. No demigod can award freedom from material bondage. That is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. Impersonalists who have no information of the Personality of Godhead minimize the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord and put Him on equal footing with all other living beings, and for this act such impersonalists get freedom from material bondage only with great difficulty. They can surrender unto Him only after many, many births in the culture of transcendental knowledge.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13729\"><p>One may argue that the Vedic activities are based on sacrificial ceremonies. That is true. But all such sacrifices are also meant for realizing the truth about V\u0101sudeva. Another name of V\u0101sudeva is Yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), and in the <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> it is clearly stated that all sacrifices and all activities are to be conducted for the satisfaction of Yaj\u00f1a, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Personality of Godhead. This is the case also with the <i>yoga</i> systems. <i>Yoga</i> means to get into touch with the Supreme Lord. The process, however, includes several bodily features such as <i>\u0101sana, dhy\u0101na, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma</i> and meditation, and all of them are meant for concentrating upon the localized aspect of V\u0101sudeva represented as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is but partial realization of V\u0101sudeva, and if one is successful in that attempt, one realizes V\u0101sudeva in full. But by ill luck most <i>yog\u012bs</i> are stranded by the powers of mysticism achieved through the bodily process. Ill-fated <i>yog\u012bs</i> are given a chance in the next birth by being placed in the families of good learned <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47as</i> or in the families of rich merchants in order to execute the unfinished task of V\u0101sudeva realization. If such fortunate <i>br\u0101hma\u1e47as</i> and sons of rich men properly utilize the chance, they can easily realize V\u0101sudeva by good association with saintly persons. Unfortunately, such preferred persons are captivated again by material wealth and honor, and thus they practically forget the aim of life.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13730\"><p>This is also so for the culture of knowledge. According to <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> there are eighteen items in culturing knowledge. By such culture of knowledge one becomes gradually prideless, devoid of vanity, nonviolent, forbearing, simple, devoted to the great spiritual master, and self-controlled. By culture of knowledge one becomes unattached to hearth and home and becomes conscious of the miseries due to death, birth, old age and disease. And all culture of knowledge culminates in devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, V\u0101sudeva. Therefore, V\u0101sudeva is the ultimate aim in culturing all different branches of knowledge. Culture of knowledge leading one to the transcendental plane of meeting V\u0101sudeva is real knowledge. Physical knowledge in its various branches is condemned in the <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> as <i>aj\u00f1\u0101na,</i> or the opposite of real knowledge. The ultimate aim of physical knowledge is to satisfy the senses, which means prolongation of the term of material existence and thereby continuance of the threefold miseries. So prolonging the miserable life of material existence is nescience. But the same physical knowledge leading to the way of spiritual understanding helps one to end the miserable life of physical existence and to begin the life of spiritual existence on the plane of V\u0101sudeva.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13731\"><p>The same applies to all kinds of austerities. <i>Tapasya</i> means voluntary acceptance of bodily pains to achieve some higher end of life. R\u0101va\u1e47a and Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu underwent a severe type of bodily torture to achieve the end of sense gratification. Sometimes modern politicians also undergo severe types of austerities to achieve some political end. This is not actually <i>tapasya.</i> One should accept voluntary bodily inconvenience for the sake of knowing V\u0101sudeva because that is the way of real austerities. Otherwise all forms of austerities are classified as modes of passion and ignorance. Passion and ignorance cannot end the miseries of life. Only the mode of goodness can mitigate the threefold miseries of life. Vasudeva and Devak\u012b, the so-called father and mother of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, underwent penances to get V\u0101sudeva as their son. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the father of all living beings <a href=\"/en/library/bg/14/4/\">(Bg. 14.4)</a>. Therefore He is the original living being of all other living beings. He is the original eternal enjoyer amongst all other enjoyers. Therefore no one can be His begetting father, as the ignorant may think. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b upon being pleased with their severe austerities. Therefore if any austerities have to be done, they must be done to achieve the end of knowledge, V\u0101sudeva.</p></div>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13732\"><p>V\u0101sudeva is the original Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As explained before, the original Personality of Godhead expands Himself by innumerable forms. Such expansion of forms is made possible by His various energies. His energies are also multifarious, and His internal energies are superior and external energies inferior in quality. They are explained in the <a href=\"/en/library/bg/7/4/\"><i>Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</i> (7.4</a>-6) as the <i>par\u0101</i> and the <i>apar\u0101 prak\u1e5btis.</i> So His expansions of various forms which take place via the internal energies are superior forms, whereas the expansions which take place via the external energies are inferior forms. The living entities are also His expansions. The living entities who are expanded by His internal potency are eternally liberated persons, whereas those who are expanded in terms of the material energies are eternally conditioned souls. Therefore, all culture of knowledge, austerities, sacrifice and activities should be aimed at changing the quality of the influence that is acting upon us. For the present, we are all being controlled by the external energy of the Lord, and just to change the quality of the influence, we must endeavor to cultivate spiritual energy. In the <i><a href=\"/en/library/bg/\">Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101</a></i> it is said that those who are <i>mah\u0101tm\u0101s,</i> or those whose minds have been so broadened as to be engaged in the service of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, are under the influence of the internal potency, and the effect is that such broadminded living beings are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord without deviation. That should be the aim of life. And that is the verdict of all the Vedic literatures. No one should bother himself with fruitive activities or dry speculation about transcendental knowledge. Everyone should at once engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Nor should one worship different demigods who work as different hands of the Lord for creation, maintenance or destruction of the material world. There are innumerable powerful demigods who look over the external management of the material world. They are all different assisting hands of Lord V\u0101sudeva. Even Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 are included in the list of demigods, but Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or V\u0101sudeva, is always transcendentally situated. Even though He accepts the quality of goodness of the material world, He is still transcendental to all the material modes. The following example will clear that matter more explicitly. In the prison house there are the prisoners and the managers of the prison house. Both the managers and the prisoners are bound by the laws of the king. But even though the king sometimes comes in the prison, he is not bound by the laws of the prison house. The king is therefore always transcendental to the laws of the prison house, as the Lord is always transcendental to the laws of the material world.</p></div>"}, {"verseNbr": "<h1>\u015aB 1.2.30</h1>", "sanskritText": "\u0938 \u090f\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0902 \u0938\u0938\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u092e\u093e\u092f\u092f\u093e \u0964<br/>\u0938\u0926\u0938\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0942\u092a\u092f\u093e \u091a\u093e\u0938\u094c \u0917\u0941\u0923\u092e\u092f\u093e\u0917\u0941\u0923\u094b \u0935\u093f\u092d\u0941: \u0965 \u0969\u0966 \u0965", "englishText": "<em><i>sa eveda\u1e41 sasarj\u0101gre<br/>bhagav\u0101n \u0101tma-m\u0101yay\u0101<br/>sad-asad-r\u016bpay\u0101 c\u0101sau<br/>gu\u1e47amay\u0101gu\u1e47o vibhu\u1e25</i></em>", "synonyms": "<p><a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=sa\u1e25\"><em>sa\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 that; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=eva\"><em>eva</em></a> \u2014 certainly; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=idam\"><em>idam</em></a> \u2014 this; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=sasarja\"><em>sasarja</em></a> \u2014 created; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=agre\"><em>agre</em></a> \u2014 before; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=bhagav\u0101n\"><em>bhagav\u0101n</em></a> \u2014 the Personality of Godhead; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=\u0101tma\"><em>\u0101tma</em></a>-<a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=m\u0101yay\u0101\"><em>m\u0101yay\u0101</em></a> \u2014 by His personal potency; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=sat\"><em>sat</em></a> \u2014 the cause; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=asat\"><em>asat</em></a> \u2014 the effect; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=r\u016bpay\u0101\"><em>r\u016bpay\u0101</em></a> \u2014 by forms; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=ca\"><em>ca</em></a> \u2014 and; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=asau\"><em>asau</em></a> \u2014 the same Lord; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=gu\u1e47a\"><em>gu\u1e47a</em></a>-<a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=maya\"><em>maya</em></a> \u2014 in the modes of material nature; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=agu\u1e47a\u1e25\"><em>agu\u1e47a\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 transcendental; <a href=\"/en/search/synonyms/?original=vibhu\u1e25\"><em>vibhu\u1e25</em></a> \u2014 the Absolute.</p>", "translation": "<p><strong>In the beginning of the material creation, that Absolute Personality of Godhead [V\u0101sudeva], in His transcendental position, created the energies of cause and effect by His own internal energy.</strong></p>", "purport": "<h2 class=\"section-title\">Purport</h2>\n<div class=\"r r-lang-en r-paragraph\" id=\"bb13738\"><p>The position of the Lord is always transcendental because the causal and effectual energies required for the creation of the material world were also created by Him.

As fire is kindled from wood by another fire, the divine consciousness of man can similarly be kindled by another divine grace. His Divine Grace the spiritual master can kindle the spiritual fire from the woodlike living entity by imparting proper spiritual messages injected through the receptive ear. Therefore one is required to approach the proper spiritual master with receptive ears only, and thus divine existence is gradually realized.
